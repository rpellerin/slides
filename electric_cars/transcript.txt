Talk about electric vehicles in general and then more specifically about Tesla.

// STATE OF THE MARKET

Just to give you an example, in France, electric vehicles represent less than 2% of the cars.

Tesla was awarded a 5-star safety rating by the National Highway Traffic in 2013.

The consumer reports rated the car 99 out of 100, that same year, which makes the Model S the best car ever created according to them.

Bar chart is pretty self-explanatory.

// HOW IT WORKS

- No fuel tank, instead one huge battery placed right on the chassis.
- 1 gear, no shifting, just like a karting. In addition, there's no transmission, it's a direct drive.
- The 290 kilowatt motor allows you to regerate power when braking. As you might have guessed, there's also no tail pipe, it's all electric.
- It's a very powerful motor capable of develiring insane thrust. The car goes up to 60 miles per hour in less than 3 seconds, depending on the motor you chose. The maximum speed is approximately 130 miles per hour. The capabilities of the car, in terms of acceleration, exceed those of a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.
